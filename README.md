# Dental Morphology Simulator in Webgl
# Overview
This project is a 3D simulation of the human dentition, developed using WebGL. The main goal is to represent the human dental structure in an interactive and visually accurate way. Each tooth is modeled and rendered individually, allowing for detailed inspection and future interaction features.

# Features
🦷 Realistic 3D models of human teeth.
👶 Support for both child and adult dentition structures.
🔄 Interactive camera controls (rotation, zoom, pan).
💡 Basic lighting and shading for depth and realism.
📐 Accurate spatial arrangement based on human anatomy.

# Technologies Used
-WebGL – for GPU-accelerated 3D rendering in the browser.
-Three.js (optional or if used) – to simplify WebGL operations.
-HTML/CSS/JavaScript – to build and style the user interface.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copiar
Editar
(poner el link)
Open the index.html file in a browser that supports WebGL.
No additional setup required if running locally. A simple HTTP server is recommended for full compatibility.

# Usage
-Use the mouse or trackpad to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene.
-View individual teeth by navigating through the dental model.
-Future versions may include interactive tooth selection and labels.

# Goals
Visualize both primary (baby) and permanent (adult) dentitions.
Allow dental students and educators to explore anatomical details.
Provide a base for possible clinical or educational extensions.
