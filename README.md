## Dental Morphology Simulator in Webgl
## Overview

This project is a 3D simulation of the human dentition, developed using WebGL. The main goal is to represent the human dental structure in an interactive and visually accurate way. Each tooth is modeled and rendered individually, allowing for detailed inspection and future interaction features.

## Features

* 🦷 Realistic 3D models of human teeth.
* 👶 Support for both child and adult dentition structures.
* 🔄 Interactive camera controls (rotation, zoom, pan).
* 💡 Basic lighting and shading for depth and realism.
* 📐 Accurate spatial arrangement based on human anatomy.

## Technologies Used

* **WebGL** – for GPU-accelerated 3D rendering in the browser
* **Three.js** (optional or if used) – to simplify WebGL operations
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – to build and style the user interface


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/scarlett-gm/Proyecto-de-PG.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser that supports WebGL.

*No additional setup required if running locally. A simple HTTP server is recommended for full compatibility.*

## Usage

* Use the mouse or trackpad to rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene.
* View individual teeth by navigating through the dental model.
* Future versions may include interactive tooth selection and labels.

## Autors

- María Reyes – Developer of adult dental morphology.  [GitHub](https://github.com/Caroreyes22)
- Scarlett Martinez – Graphical interface developer.  [GitHub](https://github.com/scarlett-gm)
- Harold Molina – 3D modeling in Blender and developer of children's dental morphology.  [GitHub](https://github.com/Yafferth14)
- Manuel Herrera – Dental office environment developer.  [GitHub](https://github.com/Mamuel0312)

## Goals

* Visualize both **primary (baby)** and **permanent (adult)** dentitions.
* Allow dental students and educators to explore anatomical details.
* Provide a base for possible clinical or educational extensions.
